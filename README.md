# Pyramid-Adventures

This project is my MOST college student research project 2021.  
And the related resource will be upload after this project done(after 2022/3/31).

## Why I design this game?
This game is based on **TAM** and **Cognitive Load Theory**, I propose one integrated model to test how this game impact students to learn Pythagorean theorem/ Pythagoras' theorem(畢氏定理).  
Because I think digital game learning can be more efficient on specific content or subject, one of this is math, I think chemistry can use this way to learn as well. I want to prove digital game learning is a good way to learn as well, not only rely on physical class.  

I hope this game can positive impact to the people who are learning Pythagorean theorem.
